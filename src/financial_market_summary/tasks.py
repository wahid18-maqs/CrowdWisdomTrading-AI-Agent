            CRITICAL - CREATE ENGAGING HOOK FROM IMAGE DESCRIPTION:
            Before sending, transform the image description into an attention-grabbing hook that:
            1. Creates curiosity and urgency ("Markets just shifted dramatically...", "Breaking: Major move in...")
            2. Highlights the most dramatic/interesting aspect from the description
            3. Uses power words: "surged", "plunged", "breaking", "historic", "unexpected", "dramatic"
            4. Asks a compelling question OR states a surprising fact
            5. Keeps it under 20 words - ultra punchy and direct
            6. Makes users want to read the full summary

            EXAMPLES OF GOOD HOOKS (‚â§20 WORDS):
            Original: "Wednesday's slide in major averages was led by the Dow Jones..."
            Hook: "‚ö†Ô∏è Dow plunges 234 points! What's triggering the sell-off? üëá" (9 words)

            Original: "The S&P 500 rose 1.2% to close at 5,850.23..."
            Hook: "üöÄ S&P 500 surges to 5,850 - best session in weeks! What's fueling this? üëá" (14 words)

            Original: "Tesla shares tumbled 8% following weak delivery figures..."
            Hook: "‚ö° Tesla crashes 8% on weak deliveries! The shocking reason üëá" (10 words)

            - Find latest screenshot from output/screenshots/

            - Send Message 2: Full summary with charts
            - Route to English bot if configured

            REMEMBER: The hook should make users STOP scrolling and READ the full summary!""",
